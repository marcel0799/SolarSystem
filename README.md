Solar System
============

This package contains exercise code for the lecture "Computer Graphics" by Prof. Dr. Mario Botsch, TU Dortmund.

Textures and Copyright
----------------------

All earth textures are from the [NASA Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/) and have been modified by Prof. Hartmut Schirmacher, Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin. All other textures are from [Solarsystemscope.com](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/). The ship model if from [free3d.com](https://free3d.com).


Documentation
-------------

A pre-built HTML documentation can be found in `doc/index.html` and can be opened via any web browser.


Prerequisites
-------------

We use [CMake](www.cmake.org) for setting up build environments. You can download it [here](https://cmake.org/download/) or by using your favorite package manager.
You will also need a C++ compiler. Depending on your OS, the typical choices are:

  * Linux - GCC/G++, usually pre-installed (terminal command: `sudo apt install build-essential`)
  * MacOS - Clang, comes with the IDE "XCode" (terminal command: `xcode-select --install`)
  * Windows - MSVC, can be installed alongside the IDE "Visual Studio Community" (see below) or separately [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other) under "All Downloads" --> "Tools for Visual Studio" --> "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019"

We highly recommend to use some kind of IDE. Prominent examples are:
 
 - [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (MacOS) 
 - [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/) (Windows)
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Linux, Windows, MacOS)
 - [Jetbrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/clion/) (Linux, Windows, MacOS)
 
Below, we provide examples for setting up, compiling and running the project via command line, XCode, VSCommunity and VSCode.


Building on Linux via Command Line (no IDE)
-------------------------------------------

Execute the following commands in the exercise's top-level directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

The last command (`make`) compiles the application. Re-run it whenever you have added/changed code in order to re-compile.

For running the code via command line use

    ./solarsystem
    
When running the `cmake ..` command, you might miss some dependencies. You can often find the missing package via a quick google search like "ubuntu missing ...".
The typical packages are given here:
    
    sudo apt-get install xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libx11-dev freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev libglew-dev

Clear the build folder's content before running `cmake ..` again. 


Building on MacOS (XCode)
--------------------------

Execute the following commands in the exercise's top-level directory:

    mkdir xcode
    cd xcode
    cmake -G Xcode ..

Open the generated .xcodeproj file. Inside XCode, select the solarsystem-executable in the top bar next to the stop button. You can run the code by pressing the play button.


Building on Windows (Visual Studio Community) 
---------------------------------------------

* In order to get the MSVC C++ compiler, make sure that you check "Desktop development with C++" during installation of [VSCommunity](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/)
* Create an empty build folder inside the project's top-level directory
* Start cmake-gui.exe (located in cmake's bin folder)
* Specify the top-level directory as source directory (button Browse source...)
* Specify the previously created build folder as build directory (button Browse build...)
* Select "Configure" using your Visual Studio Version as option.
* When configuration is finished, select "Generate".
* Start Visual Studio Community
* Open the project via File -> open -> project -> .sln in build folder
* In the project explorer window on the right, right-click the project (solarsystem) and set it as startup-project
* Switch to release mode
* Hit CTRL + F5 to build and run (or CTRL + SHIFT + B to build)


Building via VSCode
-------------------

There are a lot of useful extensions for VSCode to shape it the way you like.
The required extensions for C++ development and Cmake support are "C/C++" and "Cmake Tools". Extensions can be found in the extensions tab on the left.
Once this is done, you can set up the project:

 * Start VSCode
 * Open the project via File --> Open Folder and select the exercise's top-level directory containing the `CMakeLists.txt` file and accept by clicking `OK`
 * In the bottom bar, click on `CMake`, choose your compiler and select `Release` mode
 * In the bottom bar, click on  `[all]` and select the right target (solarsystem)
 * Still in the bottom bar, there are buttons for building (Build) and running (play symbol)

Have a look at the VSCode [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp) for further details. 


Keyboard Settings
-----------------
  * Arrow keys left/right or left mouse: 	y-rotate Camera
  * Arrow keys up/down or shift + left mouse: 	x-rotate Camera
  * 9/0:					change camera's distance to the observed object
  * 1-8:					set camera to planets/sun
  * tab:					switch mono/stereo view mode
  * r:						randomize planets' positions
  * g:						toggle greyscale
  * +/-:					increase/decrease time_step
  * space:					pause 
  * w:						toggle wireframe
  * Escape:					exit viewer
  

Recommended order for the exercises
-----------------------------------

* **Setup of an Animated Solar System:**
  * Start by placing all celestial bodies in space in `Space_Object::update()` and `Moon::update()` (`src/space_object.cpp`). The result should look similar to this (with a white background):
    ![](planet_system_initial.png)
  * Each time the system is rendered, `Planet::angle_self_` and `Planet::angle_parent_` (`src/space_object.h`) are increased in `Solar_viewer::timer()`. Use this to animate the solar system, i.e. make each body rotate around its own axis, around the sun, and -- in case of the moon -- around the earth. 
  * Allow a kind of navigation through the solar system and for a change of the camera's angle and eye's distance to the celestial body. Details can be found in `Solar_viewer::render()` and `Solar_viewer::keyboard(...)` (`src/solar_viewer.cpp`).
A video for comparison can be found in the video directory (`videos/navigation.mp4`). If you look at the system from above and wait some time-steps, the result should look similar to this:
  ![](planet_system_rotating.png)

* **Phong Lighting:**
  Implement the basic Phong shader model (`src/shader/phong.vert` and `src/shader/phong.frag`). Pass the shader variables in `Solar_viewer::draw_scene(...)`. The result should look similar to this:
  ![](venus_phong_shading.png)

* **Earth:**
  For the earth, replace the Phong shader with the earth shader (`src/shader/earth.vert` and `src/shader/earth.frag`) that features a special night, gloss and clouds texture. Pass the shader variables in `Solar_viewer::draw_scene(...)`. The result can be seen in the video `videos/earth.mp4` and should look similar to this:
  ![](earth_final.png)

* **Sunglow (optional):**
  * Let the sun shine: implement a simple billboard which is a textured quad that always faces the viewer. Fill the texture with color values in `Billboard::create_glow_texture(...)` to mimic a fading aura around the sun. The result texture should look similar to this:
    ![](sunglow.png)
  * Then, render it in `Solar_viewer::draw_scene(...)` with the color shader. Make sure, that it always faces the viewer complete `Billboard::update_angles(...)`. The result should then look like
  ![](sun_billboard.png)

* **Stereo Rendering (optional):**
  Add stereo rendering to `Solar_viewer::paint()` (`src/solar_viewer.cpp`).

* **More optional features:**
   - Try to use the sun shader for the sun, here we use a procedurally generated and animated texture for the sun.
   - Maybe you noticed, that we just draw 6 of our 8 (poor pluto) solar systems' planets. But you can find all textures (plus pluto) in you `textures` folder. So feel free to render them all.
   - In reality, a planet's orbit is not a circle but an ellipse. You can combine scaling and rotations to achieve this effect.
   - In `meshes` you find a mesh of a spaceship, you can try to read this .off file and fly with a spaceship through the solar system.
   - We are always interested in your own ideas!
